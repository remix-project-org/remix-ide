# Code Contribution Guide

Remix is an open source tool. Please help us improve it by:

- Opening issues in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/remix-project-org/remix-project).
- Writing some code and making a pulling request.

The Remix application is built with Typescript and React.

To learn more, please visit our [GitHub page](https://github.com/remix-project-org/remix-project).
